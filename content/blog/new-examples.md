In the past, the examples folder of Vult contained just a few files that were developed in an early stage. Most of the 'real' examples were developed in a separate [repository](https://github.com/modlfo/vult-examples). In order to improve the testing of the Vult compiler the examples have been moved into the Vult repository.

The examples contain different types of:

- Oscillators
- Filters
- Effects
- Full modules

One characteristic of these examples is that all of them can be directly compiled into PureData externals.

The examples folder contains as well a build system based on CMake that generates the PureData externals.

You can check the examples [here](https://github.com/vult-dsp/vult/tree/master/examples).
